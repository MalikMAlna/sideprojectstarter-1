# sideprojectstarter
Kickstart your full stack side project with a Spring Boot / PostgreSQL / Vue container setup.

## Instructions

### 1. Download and Install Docker

- Download and install Docker for your operating system from the [Docker Downloads](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) page.

### 2. Clone the Repository

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project.
- Clone the "sideprojectstarter" repository from GitHub using the following command:
  
  `git clone https://github.com/sxflynn/sideprojectstarter.git`


### 3. Start Containers

- Change your working directory to the project folder:
  
  `cd sideprojectstarter`

- Start the Docker containers using `docker-compose`:

  `docker-compose up`


### 4. Access the Vue Project

- Once the containers are up and running, your Vue.js project should be accessible at `localhost:5173` in your web browser.

Now, you have successfully set up your full stack side project with Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Vue.js using Docker containers. You can start developing your application by editing the code in the project directory.
